Mixin Class
===========

A mixin class contains your own codes, which will be applied to its target class.

Use annotation ```@Mixin``` to designate the target class.

Here is an example of a mixin class, where you can write your mixin codes. As all the mixin codes are only used by mixin and should not be instantiated, you can define your mixin class as abstract.

```java
@Mixin(TargetClass.class)
public abstract class TargetClassMixin {

}
```

Do not forget to add the class to the config file.
```json
{
  "required": true,
  "package": "com.example.modid.mixin",
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_17",
  "minVersion": "0.8",
  "refmap": "mixintest.refmap.json",
  "plugin": "com.example.modid.mixin.MixinPlugin",
  "mixins": [
    "TargetClassMixin"
  ],
  "client": [

  ],
  "injectors": {
    "defaultRequire": 1
  }
}
```
