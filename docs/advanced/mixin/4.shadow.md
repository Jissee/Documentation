@Shadow
======

Sometimes you may want to access some private fields in the target class, but there is no getter. You may also want to access some private methods. If you are tired of [Access Transformer][at] and the obfuscation mapping, the annotation ```@Shadow``` can help you solve those problems.

Fields
------
To access private fields in the target class, you just need to redefine the field with the same name in the mixin class and add the annotation ```@Shadow```. The shadowed fields should be private.

```java
@Shadow
private <type name> <field name>;
```

Then you can use this field in your mixin methods just like normal fields. The Mixin system will automatically redirect your access to the corresponding fields in the target class.


Methods
-------
To access private methods, you just need to redefine the method in the mixin class and add annotation ```@Shadow```. The shadowed methods should be protected abstract. Therefore, your mixin class must be abstract.

```java
@Shadow
protected abstract <type name> <method name>(paramerer list...);
```
Then you can call this method in your mixin methods just like normal methods. The Mixin system will automatically redirect your access to the corresponding methods in the target class.

:::tip
Do not change field names, method names, parameter types, and sequence, or the shadow will not work.

You can change parameter names.
